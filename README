Will write this soon

== Commands ==

Download and extract WordPress:

$ wp get core [<version>] [--dir-name=<directory_name>]

wp get core # get the latest version of WordPress
wp get core 3.1 # get WordPress v 3.1
wp get core 3.2-rc1 # get WordPress v 3.2 Release Candidate 1
wp get core --dir-name=application # get the latest version, but extract it to /application/ instead of /wordpress/

Download and extract a WordPress plugin:

$ wp get plugin <plugin_name> [<plugin_version>]

wp get plugin wordpress-seo # get the latest WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin
wp get plugin wordpress-seo 0.4.1 # get the WordPress SEO plugin version 0.4.1

Note: if the plugin was previously installed it will be removed before the new one is extracted.

== Future Work ==

$ wp get theme <theme_name> [<version>]
$ wp create plugin <plugin_name>
$ wp create theme <theme_name> [--parent=<parent_theme_name>]

$ wp mysql
$ wp backup [<sql|full>] <directory>
